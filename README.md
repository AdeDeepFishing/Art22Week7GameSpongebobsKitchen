 *  CODE: timer modified from: http://learningprocessing.com/examples/chp10/example-10-04-timer
 *  Make: Getting Started with Processing by Casey Reas and Ben Fry pg. 64, 159, https://www.programiz.com/java-programming/arraylist
 *  Processing Array List Reference, Processing True/False Reference
 *
 * NOTE: 
 * Yanwen worked on: welcome page, enums, patties array, scoreboard, spatula, comments
 * Simone worked on: patties array, scoreboard, comments
 * Tvisha worked on: timer, win scene, loose scene, welcome page
 *
 * Instruction: In the playing scene, users can control the (x) position of the spatula and catch the falling patties. When the spatula catch the middle part of the patties, users get 1-3 points depends on how long the spatula spend time tauching the patties. When users get over or equal to 25 points, they win. Otherwise, less than 25, they lose the game.
 *
 * Concept and Customized: Our idea was to transform pong into a single player game in which you are taksed with catching burgers in Spongebob's kitchen. Instead of a paddle, you now have a spatula, and instead of a single ball, you are catching lots of burgers. We have lots of fun images such as the Spongebob Krabby Patty kitchen background to fit the theme.
